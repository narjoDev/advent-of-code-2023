PART ONE

---Problem
add up all the part numbers (and work out which part is missing, part two?)
input schematic is a visual representation of the engine
part numbers are numbers adjacent to symbols (including diagonally)
periods are not symbols
find the sum of all the part numbers

---Examples

467..114..
...*......
..35..633.
......#...
617*......
.....+.58.
..592.....
......755.
...$.*....
.664.598..

in above, all numbers except 114 and 58 are part numbers

part numbers can be multiple digits, one digit adjacent to a symbol is sufficient
multi-digit part numbers occur on the same line (horizontally)
symbols include (possibly not limited to): *, #, +, $, -, /, =, @, %
  probably best to match anything besides a digit or dot (.)
assumption: dashes (-) immediately before digits are just symbols, i.e. there are no negative part numbers
all input lines have the same length

---Data Structures

input: 2D array of strings
  could use array indices as 'coordinates' for detecting adjacency
output: integer, sum of part numbers
intermediate...
  could store coordinates of each symbol as 2-element array, in an array of all the symbols

---Algorithm
Approach 1:
  first store coordinates of all symbols, then for each number check if adjacent coordinates are in symbol coordinates array
Approach 2:
  could 'check surroundings' each number without storing the location of the symbols
    I need a way to treat numbers as units where only one digit needs to be adjacent to a symbol, but I store the full number
      a sliding window would allow capturing both the range of indices and the content (this is the hardest part of the problem)

main:
  initialize empty part_numbers array
  (sliding window)
  for each line (row_index)
    first_digit_index initialize 0
    while first_digit_index < row size:
      if this isn't a digit:
        increment first_digit_index
      else:
        last_digit_index initialize first_digit_index
        increment last_digit_index until next is not a digit or +1 would be >= size
        number = digits in the above found range, converted to integer
        adjacent = has_adjacent_symbol?(row_index, first_digit_index, last_digit_index)
        if adjacent, add number to part_numbers
        first_digit_index = last_digit_index + 2
  return sum of part_numbers

has_adjacent_symbol?(input, row_index, first_digit_index, last_digit_index)
  search_window_top = row_index - 1, min 0
  search_window_bottom = row_index + 1, max input size - 1
  for inclusive range top..bottom
    slice x row from one less than left edge (min 0) through one more than right edge (max row size - 1)
    return true if slice has match for symbol (anything besides digits or dots)
  return false

............  8888 = number
...xxxxxx...  xxxxxx
...x8888x...  xxxxxx = search area
...xxxxxx...  xxxxxx
............

PART TWO

---Problem
determine which symbols are gears (adjacent to exactly two part numbers)
determine each gear's gear ratio (product of those two numbers)
add up all the gear ratios

---Examples

467..114..
...*......
..35..633.
......#...
617*......
.....+.58.
..592.....
......755.
...$.*....
.664.598..

Above has two gears: top left between 467 & 35, lower right between 755 & 598
We still need to find the numbers, but they need to be associated with adjacent gears

---Data Structures

---Algorithm
General Idea:
  store hash of possible gears (coordinates as keys), empty array default values
  do the same sliding window to find part numbers
    while finding part numbers, check for adjacent *s and add part number to array for that gear
  select possible gears for array length 2 (exactly two adjacent part numbers)
    map actual gears to product of numbers
    sum of ratios
    

main:
  same sliding window algorithm, EXCEPT:
    after checking if adjacent, instead of adding number to part_numbers...
    scan for adjacent stars (*) and add their coordinates to a hash
      (pass hash to helper and mutate it)
      similar algorithm to find search window, EXCEPT:
        instead of slicing row, iterate across indices
        (we need to use the indices as overall coordinates)
        key is star coordinates, value is array, push part number to array
