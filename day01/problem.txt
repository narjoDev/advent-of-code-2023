Part One
extract calibration value from each line
combine first digit and last digit into a two digit number => value
there can be other digits in between
part one: what is the sum of all the values?

map each line to its first and last digit
  option 1: filter to only digits and get first and last
  option 2: regular expression match digit with no digit before and digit with no digit after
sum

Part Two
digits can be spelled out with letters

need to scan line for either digits or spelled numbers

IMPORTANT: there can be overlapping words! (twone) => keep BOTH
z7onetwonec => 71

option 2: 
  have a single pattern that matches any digit word
  while there's a match, replace first match
  FLAW: doesn't handle overlapping words

solution: fancy lookahead regex `(?=(pattern))`
I can't say I completely understand this yet.
